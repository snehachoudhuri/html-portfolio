<h1>Sneha's Best Movies</h1>
<h2>My top 10 movies of all time are:</h2>
<hr>
<h3>1. Harry Potter</h3>
<h4>Omg why even should i explain why, it's a classic, it's the OG, it's always the cult favourite.</h4>
<h3>2. Chennai Express</h3>
<h4>U mean, u wouldn't love a movie with srk in it, with enemies to lovers trope and oh, how ur stomach aches iwith the laughter while watching this movie!!</h4>
<h3>3. Gangubai kathiawadi</h3>
<h4>Absolutely loved how fascinatingly alia played her role. One of her best characters! And mainly the message potrayed through this, it deserves a standing ovation! </h4>
<h3>4. Set It Up</h3>
<h4>I love a good rom com where the main characters search elsewhere for love and then finally get it that the answer was in front of theur eyes the entire time. The pizza scene!</h4>
<h3>5. The Ugly Truth</h3>
<h4>Enemies to lovers? Rom com? Helping-to-find-a-boyfriend-but-realise-later-u-lover-her trope? There are so many scenes I"d like to appreciate: the dance scene, lift scene, door scene, hotair balloon scene...</h4>
<h3>6. Mimi</h3>
<h4>Well written, herat warming and gives a good cry.</h4>
<h3>7. Jawan</h3>
<h4>Dynamic action packed movie with a hint of comedy, involves srk as the protagonist, delves into social and emotional issues. What more reason needed to love it?!</h4>
<h3>8. Oh, who am I even kidding? all of srk movies!!!</h3>

<h3>9. Shaitaan</h3>
<h4>Genuinely unsettling story. Also, loved the ending. I heard they are making a sequel!!</h4>
<h3>10. Isn't It Romantic</h3>
<h4>Again a searches-everywhere-for-love-but-ends-up-realising-it-was-right-in-front-of-them trope. Needless to say more..</h4>
